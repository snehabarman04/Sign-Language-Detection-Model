# Sign-Language-Detection-Model
Developed a real-time sign language detection model leveraging MediaPipe for precise hand landmark detection, and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a softmax activation function to accurately recognize hand signs. The model utilizes OpenCV's VideoCapture feature to detect and interpret user signs live through a webcam.
